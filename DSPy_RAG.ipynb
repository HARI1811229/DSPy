It also mentions E3 2017. 3. **Look for connections:** While the text doesn't explicitly state which events were highlighted *during* the 2017 Oscars, it does say that Jimmy Kimmel hosted for a second consecutive year in 2018. This implies that he likely talked about recent events during his hosting gig\n",

            "Answer: Question: A farmer has a rectangular field that is 200 meters long and 150 meters wide. He wants to add a fence around it and a gate that takes up 5 meters. How much fencing does he need?\n",
            "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the total fencing needed. First, we need to calculate the perimeter of the field (the total length of all its sides). The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding twice the length and twice the width: 2 * length + 2 * width. In this case, that's 2 * 200 meters + 2 * 150 meters = 400 meters + 30\n"
